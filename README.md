------------------------------------

The idea behind this script is to spot micro-extremes (to the upside or the downside) and anticipate the reversal. To achieve that, it uses a modelisation of the market behaviour for the last 3 days (autogenerated) and applies a RSI computation onto the delta between the buyers and the sellers for the last 14 periods (each modification of the orderbook is counted as 1 period). As another filter, we use regular Bollinger Bands applied on an 5-minutes timeframe to avoid being caught in a defavorable jump. It works at the tick level and is best suited for ranging-type price action. Additionally, we recently implemented a machine-learning module on top of all of this to detect the trend we are in...

~~Warning : The daily model generation can take up to 2 hours. You can speed up the process by activating the `force_training` setting manually. In this case, the script focuses only on building a model and stops when it's done.~~

------------------------------------

Configuration

Use python 3.10

Replace the key and secret fields with yours and adjust the number of contracts traded in sydom.py

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

------------------------------------

Execution

`python sydom.py`

During the first run, the script will automatically generate a model based on the 3 previous days of price action (if you already have an updated daily model -> set `skip_initial_training` to True). This model is retrained every day at 6:00 AM UTC. Basically, you don't have anything to do once the bot is launched...

The thresholds were defined through a manual analysis in the previous versions. All of these steps have now been automated !
